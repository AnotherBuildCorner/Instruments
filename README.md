# Instruments
Like Guitars/Basses? Have a look at my builds here.
This Repository is currently under a state of construction. But here are some headline photos to start.
It's also worth noting, aside from a single book, and some Youtube videos. I've taught myself how to do this with no classes/resources. 

In time these headings will be links to folders in the repository explaining proccesses in detail. and hopefully some videos of later builds when I started video recording the process.

## #17 Long Bass "Wave"
It was finally time, time to build a long scale bass. 
To that end I borrowed a more modern design and created this beauty.
The body is a single piece of beetle kill ash, chosen for the grain pattern along one edge, with a flame/spalted birch top with walnut middle layer. 
The neck is a multi laminate Sapelle neck with a burl maple headstock cap, stained black. and reverse tuners.
The newest addition is the linked multi-dot fretboard inlay, executed by 3D printing a special template to route into the neck.
Pickups are EMG sized custom wound Jazz bass style pickups, with 2 volume, 1 tone, 3 way selector switch, and a series parallel switch under the tone pot.

The name "Wave" will make itself known when you see the top.

## #16 Acoustic V4 "Legless"
Another experimental build. That in hindsight i shouldn't have used the back/sides set I used on it. Happily it all worked out better than I could have planned.
Why is this called "Legless?" Simply because it has a leg cutout. On an Acoustic none the less!  This is to enable a more traditional playing postition used by classical guitar players.

Sitka Spruce top with a highly figured Bubinga back and sides (Which really smells good when you're working it)  Ebony bridge with ziricote fretboard. Mahogany multi-lam neck with a 630-650mm multi scale fretboard.
This build is the third I've used the V bracing on, and the second to bear this body shape, albeit without the cutaway.  It also has the electric style heel joint with a refined neck block.

Plays as good as she looks, and She looks good if i do say so myself.

## #15 Strandberg "Era's End"
So, all of the guitars to this point share a common problem.  They don't exactly work well sitting in a chair with arms. And I found myself playing less, and so made this in an effort to change that.
Also, I'e been rather curious about how the fanned fret approach feels, and needed a challenge.  Plus around where I live, there's not a lot of great instrument stores to try out things like strandbergs and the like. So if i want to experiece something, I typically have to make it.  This is no different.

The top is a very special piece of semi spalted walnut, something that came from a much larger board, but only a small section had this appearance. 
The back is beetle kill ash, I cut down and harested myself.
The neck is a mahogany multi laminate neck with Ziricote fretboard.
Just some basic 5 way wiring with the 2 and 4 positions being split humbuckers.  The neck pickup is a Seymour Duncan, Seth Lover i bought many years ago. while the bridge is made by yours truly.
Sadly, this guitar also straddles a major life event, and not a nice one either.  But I will keep the details to myself.

## #14 LP Special "Deep Blue"
Another gift guitar. Specifically a wedding gift And quite frankly I almost didn't let this one go either.
The original inspiration is more a matter of frustration. After experiencing the Les Paul Tribute owned by who now posesses this beauty. I couldn't accept the fact the fretboard had shrunk in relation to the neck, leaving a nasty little ridge.
The body is a single piece of beetle kill ash, With a cherry multi laminate neck, tune-O-Matic bridge and Walnut tailpiece.
Finished with Angelus blue leather dye on the body and a copper leaf arm bevel, all under straight from the spray gun nitrocellulose lacquer. This one has a feel that's hard to beat. Simple wiring with 3 way switch, handwound humbuckers, with a series/parallel enabled on the neck pickup.  For a short while the neck pickup was wired horribly wrong. 
In essence, Humbuckers are two identical coils, with the start wires tied together, with the finish wires being the hot and ground. this produces the hum cancelling effect.  Well. I wired it start-finish in the middle, which didn't produce a lot of noise but essentially created a massive single coil.  Sounded surprisingly good. But parallel is a close match, with less noise.  hence the series/parallel switching.

Oh, and this is a first for me, Stainless steel frets.

## #13 Strat "Goldie"
Sometimes, you set out to build something, and find the pieces to make it.
Other times, the pieces tell you what to build.  This represents the latter.
The body is a piece of Spanish Cedar, which is fine subsitute for traditional mahogany. 
The top is a walnut block from the cheap bin, resawed in half, epoxy filled to stabilize the cracks. Finished in gloss 2K lacquer and polished to a high gloss.
the neck is roasted Flame neck. with a Ziricote fretboard with hollow tube inlays.

three handwound pickups fill out the electronics in a HSS configuration. The electronics have a few secrets. standard 5 way wiring, with a neck enable switch, a 3 position Series/Split/Parallel for the Humbucker, and hidden under the tone pot, is an inductive tone filter as well as a traditional high roll off.

Careful,  The top is hard to look away from once you see it.

## #12 Acoustic V3 Gretch
The 3rd acoustic style. This one represents a departure from previous designs by pulling inspiration from Archtop Acoustic/Electrics.
The first build i've done using a TuneO-Matic bridge/ The top has a brace located where the bridge studs thread into. Chosen because pressing in studs on an acoustic is a terrible idea, and the design didnt call for an archtop floating bridge.
Sitka spruce top, Walnut back and sides. with an electric style neck joint, deep cutaway and offset design for ergonomics. and two splittable humbucker pickups with Ziricote inserts.

## #11 Bass VI
Its a Guitar... no it's a Bass...  NO   ITS A BASS VI!
Tuned E-E, like a guitar, but down a full octave like a bass, with a 30.5 inch scale length and guitar sized neck. This is a monster of an instrument. Many don't know of this class of instruments, but can famously be heard on some Beetles tracks among other tracks.
The design is a sort of modified Firebird. So heavily modified it's no longer recognizeable.
Ths one sports a curly ash top, with a Beetle kill ash back, A tree I personally cut down. With flame maple binding.
The top has been flame accented to highlight some of the darker grain.  Neck is a jatoba multi laminate with center stripe.
Internally the body is filled with series of small circular chambers for weight releif.
Pickups are hand wound alnico pole pickups sized after Bass VI pickups, except the bridge is more of a jazzmaster style for a bit more midrange.

## #10 the Blueberry Baritone.
So called because the color scheme is a sort of Blueberry Burst, and is a long scale (28.5 inch) Baritone design.
Again based off of the Yard Pine body. and a Novo body style (Quite frankly I love the ergonomics, and could never afford to buy one. So I build for myself, not for sale)
this one sports a multi laminate Jatoba neck and a new headstock. Originally I planned to use a roasted maple neck, but it was too short, even with the new headstock design.
Also, the pickguard is a laminated aluminium and walnut guard for shielding and stability. With 2 tone block inlays.

the pickups are both hand wound, one is a Firebird, and the other is a mini humbucker. (internally the difference is in magnet placement)

It's also right around this time where I transistioned from a basic winder using nothing but a variable speed drill.
To a custom built winder with CNC capabilites, based around common RC motors and servos, powered by an Arduino microcontroller.

## #9 Acoustic Version 2
Finally, it's time to take a shot at another acoustic. But being a glutton for punishment, I can't just keep it simple.
So tho that end, this is a Sapelle (cut from my own supplies, not pre-thinned) and red cedar model. with a deep florentine cutaway.

but the three parts that make it a challenge. One is purple heart binding... which has a strong proclivity to snap, not bend.
I added an arm bevel, which is a relatively advanced technique.
and... I decided to try and copy the new Taylor V-Class bracing instead of traditional X-bracing, for an extra challenge.
The only data I had to go on at the time, was a single off axis photo showing an already braced top. no dimensions or anything else.
Oh, and I applied binding to the fretboard too.

Well it worked out great, the build has a great deep bass without sounding too dark.

## #8 The Light Esquire

This is an exercise in using spare parts.
From the original esquire build I has a body blank saved, what was perfect for a japanese Kinsugi approach, by layering black and blue dye into the knot, and adding gold into the cracks.
The neck is a piece of roasted maple with a Sugi Ban (charred) finish on part.  I also had to make a special spacer because the headstock was too thin for locking tuners,  apparently theyre thicker than regular tuners. this was my first experience with them.
Also, the freboard is a roasted birdseye maple. with a hummingbird inlay. My first go at a large inlay design.
I don't have many pictures of this build sadly.

## #7 The Jazzmaster style.
This is what happens when fall-winter boredom sets in
So the first thing is I set about making the pickups, in the jazzmaster style, but without the screw tabs.  The result were these fine walnut capped alnico pole pickups.
The next was to take on a proper fretboard inlay.
Again this is a yard-pine body, not tempered, as that proved to be a smelly disaster in the oven. With a dark tempered maple neck, and a piece of slightly spalted maple for the top I saved from some of the other house project wood.
Also this is my second go at binding a guitar, this time with Wenge...  Do not reccomend Wenge for binding.

## #6 The Dark Esquire

This is my first, and to  date only comissioned guitar. 
Again using tempered materials, this time purchased from a supplier, this is a roasted maple and tempered pine design.
Telecaster body with arm and back bevel for comfort.
a single DiMarzio super distortion in the bridge, with dual concentric tone knobs, and a 3 way switch that selects either tone knob, or removes them from the circuit.
The trickiest part was getting the satin finish just right... And frankly that never quite happened.

## #5 Hyperlight V2, Aqua
If you scroll down a bit, you'll find the first version of this guitar.
This one is identical in construction. with the only change being a blue dyed body instead of the black and red.
Turns out the friend I mentioned, also fell for the Phoenix build, enough so I quietly built this copy of it to gift him.

## #4, the Hyperlight "Phoenix"
This build was originally conceived as a surprise gift for a friend, as well as a way to challenge some basic assumptions about what makes for a good instrument.
It's called the Phoenix, because it's conception is highly surrounded in fire, and transformation of materials into a new life.

The neck is the second go at a tempered maple neck, which scorched along one edge.
The body is white pine, harvested from my own yard, and in a way is my sweet revenge on a tree that crushed a car in my yard, one I had just finished fixing... (Plus, it was free material)
The pine was then tempered in the oven, again targeting the Novo style build. This time I borrowed their body shape, as I wanted something more refined for my friend, as I haven't quite found my own body style yet.
This is then chambered for maximum weight relief, and mated to a cedar top from some leftover cladding.

The pickups are Firebirds, to find that sound a bit Telecaster-like, without the noise (This came from the friend's liking of Telecsters, while not appeciating the ergonomics or noise)
Also, the pickups were handwound and assembled by myself. One more step up in complexity.

The top was then grain raised and scraped back to produce the unique pattern on the top. Finished in spray can Nitrocellulose lacquer, hopefully it will wear in with age nicely.
I fell for this build once it was complete, so much so that I kept it.

## #3 Electric, Version 2.
This one takes some material inspiration from a company in Nashville called "Novo". They exclusively use "tempered" materials. or woods that have been temperature modified to replicate old, dried out wood.
So i decided to take a shot at it myself with nothing more than a home oven.
This is an Ash body/ Maple cap and maple neck build. with the body and neck being home tempered.  the top was left unmodified.
For weight reduction, the body is chambered. Hand finished in shellac.

This first round of tempering experiments needed a little more heat, as the results came out a dull grey, not quite the rich golden colors expected.

## #2, The first Acoustic.
My second build ever, A walnut and Red cedar acoustic based loosely on a Martin 000/ Taylor Grand Concert. So a slightly smaller body.
Sporting a cherry neck and Wenge fretboard. this represents a significant increase in difficulty from the first, being an acoustic. 
Ultimately, she's a little too overbraced and sounds tinny as a result. Not uncommon in new acoustic builders

## The Original:
The one that started it all. Built in a single car garage with a very small amount of tools. There really isn't a lot of photos to document this build.
