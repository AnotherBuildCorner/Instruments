# Instruments
Like Guitars/Basses? Have a look at my builds here.
This Repository is currently under a state of construction. But here are some headline photos to start.
It's also worth noting, aside from a single book, and some Youtube videos. I've taught myself how to do this with no classes/resources. 

In time these headings will be links to folders in the repository explaining proccesses in detail. and hopefully some videos of later builds when I started video recording the process.

## #10 the Blueberry Baritone.
So called because the color scheme is a sort of Blueberry Burst, and is a long scale (28.5 inch) Baritone design.
Again based off of the Yard Pine body. and a Novo body style (Quite frankly I love the ergonomics, and could never afford to buy one. So I build for myself, not for sale)
this one sports a multi laminate Jatoba neck and a new headstock. Originally I planned to use a roasted maple neck, but it was too short, even with the new headstock design.
Also, the pickguard is a laminated aluminium and walnut guard for shielding and stability. With 2 tone block inlays.

the pickups are both hand wound, one is a Firebird, and the other is a mini humbucker. (internally the difference is in magnet placement)

## #9 Acoustic Version 2
Finally, it's time to take a shot at another acoustic. But being a glutton for punishment, I can't just keep it simple.
So tho that end, this is a Sapelle (cut from my own supplies, not pre-thinned) and red cedar model. with a deep florentine cutaway.

but the three parts that make it a challenge. One is purple heart binding... which has a strong proclivity to snap, not bend.
I added an arm bevel, which is a relatively advanced technique.
and... I decided to try and copy the new Taylor V-Class bracing instead of traditional X-bracing, for an extra challenge.
The only data I had to go on at the time, was a single off axis photo showing an already braced top. no dimensions or anything else.
Oh, and I applied binding to the fretboard too.

Well it worked out great, the build has a great deep bass without sounding too dark.

## #8 The Light Esquire

This is an exercise in using spare parts.
From the original esquire build I has a body blank saved, what was perfect for a japanese Kinsugi approach, by layering black and blue dye into the knot, and adding gold into the cracks.
The neck is a piece of roasted maple with a Sugi Ban (charred) finish on part.  I also had to make a special spacer because the headstock was too thin for locking tuners,  apparently theyre thicker than regular tuners. this was my first experience with them.
Also, the freboard is a roasted birdseye maple. with a hummingbird inlay. My first go at a large inlay design.
I don't have many pictures of this build sadly.

## #7 The Jazzmaster style.
This is what happens when fall-winter boredom sets in
So the first thing is I set about making the pickups, in the jazzmaster style, but without the screw tabs.  The result were these fine walnut capped alnico pole pickups.
The next was to take on a proper fretboard inlay.
Again this is a yard-pine body, not tempered, as that proved to be a smelly disaster in the oven. With a dark tempered maple neck, and a piece of slightly spalted maple for the top I saved from some of the other house project wood.
Also this is my second go at binding a guitar, this time with Wenge...  Do not reccomend Wenge for binding.

## #6 The Dark Esquire

This is my first, and to  date only comissioned guitar. 
Again using tempered materials, this time purchased from a supplier, this is a roasted maple and tempered pine design.
Telecaster body with arm and back bevel for comfort.
a single DiMarzio super distortion in the bridge, with dual concentric tone knobs, and a 3 way switch that selects either tone knob, or removes them from the circuit.
The trickiest part was getting the satin finish just right... And frankly that never quite happened.

## #5 Hyperlight V2, Aqua
If you scroll down a bit, you'll find the first version of this guitar.
This one is identical in construction. with the only change being a blue dyed body instead of the black and red.
Turns out the friend I mentioned, also fell for the Phoenix build, enough so I quietly built this copy of it to gift him.

## #4, the Hyperlight "Phoenix"
This build was originally conceived as a surprise gift for a friend, as well as a way to challenge some basic assumptions about what makes for a good instrument.
It's called the Phoenix, because it's conception is highly surrounded in fire, and transformation of materials into a new life.

The neck is the second go at a tempered maple neck, which scorched along one edge.
The body is white pine, harvested from my own yard, and in a way is my sweet revenge on a tree that crushed a car in my yard, one I had just finished fixing... (Plus, it was free material)
The pine was then tempered in the oven, again targeting the Novo style build. This time I borrowed their body shape, as I wanted something more refined for my friend, as I haven't quite found my own body style yet.
This is then chambered for maximum weight relief, and mated to a cedar top from some leftover cladding.

The pickups are Firebirds, to find that sound a bit Telecaster-like, without the noise (This came from the friend's liking of Telecsters, while not appeciating the ergonomics or noise)
Also, the pickups were handwound and assembled by myself. One more step up in complexity.

The top was then grain raised and scraped back to produce the unique pattern on the top. Finished in spray can Nitrocellulose lacquer, hopefully it will wear in with age nicely.
I fell for this build once it was complete, so much so that I kept it.

## #3 Electric, Version 2.
This one takes some material inspiration from a company in Nashville called "Novo". They exclusively use "tempered" materials. or woods that have been temperature modified to replicate old, dried out wood.
So i decided to take a shot at it myself with nothing more than a home oven.
This is an Ash body/ Maple cap and maple neck build. with the body and neck being home tempered.  the top was left unmodified.
For weight reduction, the body is chambered. Hand finished in shellac.

This first round of tempering experiments needed a little more heat, as the results came out a dull grey, not quite the rich golden colors expected.

## #2, The first Acoustic.
My second build ever, A walnut and Red cedar acoustic based loosely on a Martin 000/ Taylor Grand Concert. So a slightly smaller body.
Sporting a cherry neck and Wenge fretboard. this represents a significant increase in difficulty from the first, being an acoustic. 
Ultimately, she's a little too overbraced and sounds tinny as a result. Not uncommon in new acoustic builders

## The Original:
The one that started it all. Built in a single car garage with a very small amount of tools. There really isn't a lot of photos to document this build.
